#Interactive Form

With this project, a static form will be transformed into an interactive one. 

In here you will find:
- Dynamic uses of javascript (appending input fields).
- Functions that can append and validate code.
- Vanilla javascript that doesn't use the snippets or plugins.
- Uses of CSS Selectors
- Traversing and making changes to the DOM
- Regular Expressions
